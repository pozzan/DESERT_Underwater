DESERT Underwater
=================

**DESERT Underwater: an NS-Miracle extension to** 
**DEsign, Simulate, Emulate and Realize Test-beds**
**for Underwater network protocols**

DESERT Underwater is a complete set of public C++ libraries that extend
the NS-Miracle simulator to support the design and implementation of 
underwater network protocols. Its creation stems from the will to push 
the studies on underwater networking beyond simulations. 
Implementing research solutions on actual devices, in fact, is of key 
importance to realize a communication and networking architecture that 
allows heterogeneous nodes to communicate reliably in the underwater 
environment.
