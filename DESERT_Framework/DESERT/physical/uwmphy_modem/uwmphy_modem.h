 * The main class implementing the module used to implement the interface between ns2/NS-Miracle and real acoustic modems. UWMPhy_modem (as well as its possible derived classes) handles all the messages needed by NS-Miracle (e.g., cross-layer messages between MAC and PHY)  and contains all the variables set by the tcl-user; furthermore, this module coordinates the interactions between UWMcodec and UWMdriver. This class replaces the physical layer of NS-Miracle and inherits from MPhy (see NS-Miracle documentation at  http://telecom.dei.unipd.it/ns/miracle/doxygen/classMPhy.html).
