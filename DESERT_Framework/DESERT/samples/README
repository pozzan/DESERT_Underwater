In these two sub-folders you can find several tcl samples to test the various features of DESERT. 
Each sample has the name of the most representative module tested in that sample 
However, in each samples a complete stack and a network of at least two nodes is set up.
If you need help with tcl and the samples, you can refer to the pdf files that you can find 
within each folder.
Each pdf file explains in detail one representative tcl file, and is therefore very useful to
understand the general structure of a tcl file before starting to build your own.
