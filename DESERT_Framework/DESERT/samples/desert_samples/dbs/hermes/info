This database provide performace figures of packet delivery ratio (PDR) versus transmission range, measured during real test campaigns. When using the Hermes simulator, specify the path of which lookup table you want to use, and then initialize the physical layer. Set the spectral mask according to the info provided in this file.

default.csv is an example for MODE5.
