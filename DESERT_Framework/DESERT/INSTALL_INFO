If DESERT folder is still compressed, extract it and go to the newly created directory (that can be placed wherever you like).

Do the followings:

1. cd DESERT
2. run ./autogen.sh
3. run ./configure with the following options
    * --with-ns-allinone=<ns2-allinone_path>
    * --with-nsmiracle=<ns-miracle_path>
    * --prefix=<path_where_libraries_will_be_installed> (this path is optional. If used, this path must be added to the environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH of the ~\.bashrc file. Please refer also to NS-Miracle documentation for more info.)
4. run make
5. run make install

If you encounter any problem while building this library, you can refer to the nsmiracle-users mailing list (https://mail.dei.unipd.it/mailman/listinfo/nsmiracle-users).

If you want to use DESERT with WOSS (World Ocean Simulation System), install WOSS following the instructions that you can find on http://telecom.dei.unipd.it/ns/woss/doxygen/installation.html website.
- Please be careful that you need to install WOSS WITH the support of ns-miracle and ns2, so you have to run the configure script with all the options
- NOTE: In order to run the DESERT Underwater libraries, you must install the version of WOSS that you can download from the DESERT website (i.e., version 1.2) and not more recent versions that are not yet fully compatible with DESERT. 

Once you have successfully installed WOSS version 1.2, follow these steps to correctly install DESERT with the support of WOSS:

If DESERT folder is still compressed, extract it and go to the newly created directory (that can be placed wherever you like). Then:
1. cd DESERT
2. run ./autogen.sh --with-woss
3. run ./configure with the following options
	* --with-ns-allinone=<ns-allinone-path>
	* --with-nsmiracle=<ns-miracle-path>
	* --with-woss=<woss-path>
	* --prefix=<path_where_libraries_will_be_installed> (this path is optional. If used, this path must be added to the environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH of the ~\.bashrc file.
4. run make
5. run make install

If you encounter any problem with building DESERT or WOSS, you can refer to the nsmiracle-users mailing list (https://mail.dei.unipd.it/mailman/listinfo/nsmiracle-users).
