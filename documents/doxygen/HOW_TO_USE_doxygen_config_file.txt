- If you are using an ubuntu like distro open the terminal and type: "sudo apt-get install doxygen"
- Download the script and save it in the folder of your DESERT local copy (or another folder)
- line 32: add the relative path to the folders containing files with doxygen documentation (the procedure is recursive);
- line 80: if you want, you can change the output folder (the default one is ./desert_doc_1);
- line 288: check that all the extensions (.h, .cc etc) are already included;
- Compile the script from the terminal by: doxygen doxygen_config_file
- You can open the docx by cd in ./desert_doc and opening index.html with your browser;
- Don't worry too much about the warning in the terminal that you could receive.
